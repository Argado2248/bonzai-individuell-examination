                    <p class="aboutus__info">
                        Bonz.ai was born from a simple yet powerful vision: what
                        if hotels could be both luxurious and sustainable? What
                        if technology could enhance rather than harm our planet?
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutus__info">
                        In 2023, we opened our doors as the world's first fully
                        AI-integrated, carbon-negative hotel. Every aspect of
                        Bonz.ai has been designed to minimize environmental
                        impact while maximizing guest comfort through
                        intelligent systems that learn and adapt.

                    <p class="aboutus__info">
                        We believe that the future of hospitality isn't about
                        choosing between luxury and responsibility— it's about
                        creating experiences where both thrive together. Our AI
                        doesn't just make your stay more convenient; it helps us
                        operate more efficiently, reducing waste and energy
                        consumption while providing personalized service that
                        feels almost magical.
